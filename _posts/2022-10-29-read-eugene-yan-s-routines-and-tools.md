It’s always great reading other people’s routine. Today, I read Eugene Yan’s [routine](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/how-to-accomplish-more-with-less/). I’m not familiar with his overall work but his article on the [advantages of simplicity](read-simplicity-is-an-advantage-but-sadly-complexity-sells-better) is awesome. His bio is impressive as the article so I’m curious how he’s able to do all of that. 

After reading some productive people's routines, I can see two types of routines:

1. The routine is elaborate and complex with multiple moving pieces and systems.
2. The routine is simple to the point of me thinking "Huh, that's reasonably simple. That's not what I expected."

Eugene's routine is the second type. It also speaks a lot to how he was able to compose his article on simplicity: he himself keeps his daily routines simple yet still impactful. I realised that I'm implicitly looking for complicated system when what I needed is something simpler yet still powerful. The power of a simple system is it's easier to maintain and that's a huge advantage compared to a complicated system.

I need to think more on this.
