I'm quite tired today because of Sialadenitis (did I type that right?). I'm reading Jon Kabat-Zinn's Full Catastrophe Living and the people who attended his MBSR program are quite admirable. I'm ashamed of myself when I read that those people have conditions that are much worse than my ephemeral Sialadenitis yet they were still able to make the best out of life.
