For those looking for another intuitive explanation for logistic regression, give [this article](https://mlu-explain.github.io/logistic-regression/) by [MLU-Explain](https://mlu-explain.github.io/) a read. 

The article provides a simple explanation for logistic regression, with appropriate and sufficiently few sprinkles of maths, plus interactive graphs. Highly recommended especially for those who want to start small and don't want to jump in the weeds e.g. reading textbooks.
