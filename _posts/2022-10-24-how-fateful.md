This article illustrates how illuminating data analysis can be in our day-to-day lives. The writer, Channon Perry, felt regretful that she and her boyfriend didn’t have a cute story about the day they met. With the help of R and Google’s location history data from both of them, she tried to create an even more interesting story: how many times have their paths criss-crossed before they "met". It ended with a number and a reflection on the impact an unnoticed stranger could potentially have on our future self.

This is a romance-ish story and like any other story, spoilers are frowned upon so I'll refrain from sharing the results.

On the 16th of August 2017, exactly one week short of three years before we would meet, we’re recorded at the same GPS coordinates in this spot where I frequently had
lunch, near a coffee booth in the social sciences building. Did he just trot past on the stairs? Did he take a seat in the shade under the trees? Did we queue together in line for coffee? I guess Google doesn’t have the answer for everything. but it’s pleasant to imagine when we have our coffee together every morning that years before we may have silently enjoyed coffee near each other.
