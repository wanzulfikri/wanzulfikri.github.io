I used to not care about any sickness that ailed me in the past. But these days, I don't know if I still see things that way.

Weirdly enough, I don't mind if a sickness abruptly puts me into a grave. Though, I do mind if the sickness doesn't kill and instead "mercifully" let me live with the caveat that my quality of life goes down the drain. Well, aging is already capable of reducing my quality of life so maybe I'll have to accept that it's going to happen anyway.

This acceptance business is super tough.
