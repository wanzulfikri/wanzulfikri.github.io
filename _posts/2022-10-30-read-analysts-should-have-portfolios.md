[This](https://benn.substack.com/p/analysts-should-have-portfolios) is a somewhat atypical article about the importance of portfolios.

It emphasised why portfolios are important in the first place: to understand how the candidate thinks.

> Though a portfolio could also include code, the point isn’t to share SQL snippets or a few Jupyter notebooks; it’s to talk about the thinking around the code. As an interviewer, I want to understand how candidates translate a vague business problem into a quantitative one, and how they navigate the inevitable frustrations of their first efforts not working out. I want to hear about what unexpected things they uncovered, and how they found them. I want to learn how they explain problems and tell stories. And as a candidate, I want to share a bit about myself—the projects I’ve enjoyed, the things I’m proud of, and the work I want to do.

Interestingly and probably due to the previous reason, a simple deck (around eight slides or so) is suggested for any analysts to have:

> A simple deck—the sort of thing for which a first draft could be made in a few hours—could accomplish all of this. Inspired by the overly prescriptive spirit of a five-paragraph essay,6 here’s how I’d do it in eight slides:
>
> - Slide 1: A cover slide. Your name, some punchy catch phrase, and cool hero image that you found on a Google image search for “ambition photograph nature.”
> - Slide 2: A brief bio. A timeline of your career, with notes about each role. Your LinkedIn profile, basically.
> - Slide 3: A big problem you worked on. Introduce one of your biggest or most impactful projects from a recent job. What was the problem?
> - Slide 4: Your solution. How did you solve the problem in the prior slide? Include screenshots of charts, reports, or architectural diagrams of what you built.
> - Slides 5 and 6: A project that you’re proud of. In the same two-slide format, talk through a problem you’re particularly proud of solving. Instead of a “big” one that you’d typically put on your resume, choose something that demonstrates what type of work you find exciting and motivating.
> - Slides 7 and 8: A project that differentiates you. In two slides again, talk through something you’ve worked on that captures who you are as an analyst. What would make people remember you, and differentiates you from other candidates?

And lastly, some excellent reasons were given on why using short slide decks can improve everyone's experience - both the talented candidate who's applying for the job and the employer who wants talented candidates.

> First, this would reorient analytical jobs away from technical skills and towards the creative reasoning skills that they actually require. Whether we like it or not, job candidates are going to teach themselves to the test: So long as we use take-home SQL assignments and whiteboard coding exercises in our interview processes, that’s what people will try to learn. Throwing those out in favor of a more creative portfolio proves to candidates that we’re serious about certain technical skills being “nice to haves.” Just as design portfolios push designers’ choice of tools into the background in favor of highlighting what they actually create, an analytical portfolio puts analysis in front of the languages with which it was performed.
> 
> Second, portfolios are an equal opportunity asset. Recent grads can show off school work and personal projects. People looking to make career transitions can include side projects that show their potential as an analyst. Moreover, because portfolios let people tell the story of how they did their work, small projects can be just as compelling as big ones.
> 
> Third, the structure of the portfolio itself—the narrative frame around the analytical pictures—is another useful way for candidates to differentiate themselves. Analysts aren't just actuaries who take in and spit out numbers; they're storytellers who need to be engaging and persuasive. Developing and presenting a portfolio allows for exactly that. 
>
> Fifth, interviews would be better. Portfolios could replace controversial take-home tests, which turn some candidates away, with material that could be repurposed for every interview (analyst portfolios, the common app for data jobs). Portfolios also give potential employers more context about applicants, allowing interviewers to cover more ground in their conversations with candidates.
