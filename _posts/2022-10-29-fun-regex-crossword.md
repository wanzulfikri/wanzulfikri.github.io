I just finished the last graded lab of the [Using Python to Interact with the Operating System](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-operating-system?specialization=google-it-automation) course on Coursera. The lab overall was doable but I got stuck on one thing â€“ Regex. As always, Regex made me think I wasn't cut out to be a programmer.

Learning Regex is weird though. It's one of things that gives you this seemingly innate feeling of wanting to run away mostly because of the somewhat cryptic and foreign syntax. It's also one of those things that when you supress that desire to run away and force yourself to look at it intensely, you can appreciate how useful and fascinating it really is. And it's also one of those things that when you thought you knew enough to at least solve some basic problems and then out of the blue, you encountered a Regex problem you can't solve.

All in all, Regex is fun. So to spread that joy, I suggest you visit this [Regex crossword](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-operating-system?specialization=google-it-automation) website which was suggested by the aforementioned course and try some of the crosswords.
