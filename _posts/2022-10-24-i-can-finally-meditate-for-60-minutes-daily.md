title: I can finally meditate for 60 minutes daily

I was skeptical that I can meditate for anything more than 30 minutes but here I am, on my third day of meditating 60 minutes every day.

Do I feel any improvement? I can't say for sure. Maybe I did change in some way but the change is subtle, or maybe I'm just the same (maybe that's what meditation is: after meditating for a while, you are still the same you, yet paradoxically different). Even if I gained nothing, the meditation experience itself is a wortwhile reason to keep meditating daily.
