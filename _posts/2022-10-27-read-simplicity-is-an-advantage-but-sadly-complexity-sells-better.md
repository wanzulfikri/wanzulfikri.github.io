A delightful [article](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/simplicity/) that describes succinctly simplicity's advantage over complexity yet surprising enough, complexity "sells" better. Complexity sells better here is not just limited to selling things in the monetary sense. Consider the following [comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32671328) on Hacker News:

> It really is a great phrase. I think there's some truth to it. As someone who can be very articulate at times, the influence it lends me isn't always commensurate with my actual skill in that area. Put another way; I've found if you use enough big words and say enough clever things, people will treat you as if you're smart even on unrelated matters.

The phrase the commenter refers to is "The Dictatorship of the Articulate" which comes from this eponymous [article](https://flocrivello.com/the-dictatorship-of-the-articulate/) (I don't recommend reading it because the quality of the article is less than the article's title). One way an articulate person can make people buy their ideas is by explaining things in a complicated way to the point that people's incomprehension is perceived as a good thing i.e. the articulate person is seen as smarter than them.

Going back to the original article, the most important lesson is to be aware when we confuse what complexity signals vs what complexity actually brings:

> Complexity signals effort. Papers with difficult ideas and technical details suggest blood, sweat, and tears. Systems with more components and features hint at more effort than systems with less. Because complex artifacts are viewed as requiring more effort, they’re also deemed as more challenging to create and thus more worthy. And because of the perceived effort involved, they’re often judged to be higher quality.

Hard work is admirable but it's not always the case that hard work produces high quality work. The cliche "Work Smart Not Hard" is an apt reminder in this kind of situation where we have too much bias towards effort. Ideally, we need both smart work and hard work, but if we have to choose, working smarter is a better use of our time.

> Complexity signals mastery. A complex system with many moving parts suggests that the designer has proficiency over each part and the ability to integrate them. Inaccessible papers peppered with jargon and proofs demonstrate expertise on the subject. (This is also why we quiz interview candidates on algorithms and data structures that are rarely used at work.) If laymen have a hard time understanding the complex idea or system, its creator must be an expert, right?

It is somewhat true that complexity indicates mastery. But when looking at mastery as a spectrum, then not being able to convert that complexity into something simpler is a sign that we are on the side of less mastery. 

> Complexity signals innovation. Papers that invent entirely new model architectures are recognized as more novel relative to papers that adapt existing networks. Systems with components built from scratch are considered more inventive than systems that reuse existing parts. Work that just builds on or reuses existing work isn’t that innovative.

This is probably a side-effect of many simple yet elegant things have already been discovered and now people are scrambling to find something else to topple the simple things. Instead of looking for simpler solutions, we opted for complexity instead because that's the easiest way to appear innovative.

A simple, brief, and very interesting read. Do [read](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/simplicity/) it.
