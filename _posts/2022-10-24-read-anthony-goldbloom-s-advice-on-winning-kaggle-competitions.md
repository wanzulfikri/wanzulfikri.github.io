I haven't participated in a Kaggle competition yet. Partly because I'm still going through the Dataquest Data Scientist Path, and another part is well, I have no clue whether I'm good enough yet.

A few day ago, I read [this](https://www.import.io/post/how-to-win-a-kaggle-competition/?utm_source=pocket_mylist) which is an interview with Kaggle CEO and Founder, Anthony Goldbloom. The following excerpt is simple but interesting:

> According to Anthony, in the history of Kaggle competitions, there are only two Machine Learning approaches that win competitions: Handcrafted & Neural Networks.

The "Handcrafted" word appeals to me (I don't know a thing about Neural Networks). Recently, I did a simple machine learning project using the Linear Regression and crafting features is an involved task. It requires domain knowledge and an intuitive sense of how one feature relates to another. 

To be honest, I'm still very lazy so I took the easy way out by not crafting anything: just use the features already available in the the data set and pray that they're good enough. Definitely something I want to work on.
